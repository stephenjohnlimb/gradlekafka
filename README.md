## A Refactor from the boot repository

I thought I'd extract the kafka part from the boot repository and also use 'gradle' as the main build mechanism.

I've extracted the `topic` names out of the source and added them to application.properties.

### Gradle configuration
I've never really done any gradle before, but have used:
- make
- imake
- ant
- ivy
- maven

So the general concepts of **source files**, **dependencies** and
resulting **artefacts** is pretty familiar to me.

I found 'gradle' to be pretty straight forward to get started with,
